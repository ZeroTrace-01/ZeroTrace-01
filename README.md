he lets his tools speak for him."*

## 👨‍💻 About Me
I am a Python-based tool developer who focuses on building automation tools, scanners, and utilities for security testing.  
I believe that a true pentester is not measured by tools he uses, but by logic, patience, and discipline.

## ⚙️ What I Do
- Build custom tools using **Python**
- Create automation scripts for testing & analysis
- Develop CLI-based utilities
- Focus on efficiency, simplicity, and clean logic
